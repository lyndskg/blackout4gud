# blackout4gud

blackout4gud is an iOS app that *actually* pays for minimizing screentime. Users may elect to have the money deposited to themselves, or for a specific charity or cause that they would like to support. 

A single-pot GoFundMe will be created and maintained by blackout4gud, where all "crowdfunding" will be done so using user-accrued points (with no action required from users' end). However, for every blackout session designated for charity, blackout4gud promises to donate to the user's cause of choice using money sourced from the GoFundMe.
  
Upon app download and account creation, users will be asked to allow certain device permissions in order to track your screentime. Furthermore, a valid payment method / bank account must be provided.

When users decide to start the blackout timer, points will be accrued based on the amount of time that the display is fully turned off -- barring notifications (the timer will go until the phone is unlocked).
Before every session, users must specify where the proceeds of their blackout will go. As an added incentive, charitable donations will accrue a point multiplier, whereas self-directed payment will not.

As of now, the time-to-points ratio is pre-defined, but may be affected by limited-time promotions in the future.

blackout4gud also features CHALLENGE mode: Users can challenge themselves to go a self-selected amount of time without using their phone.
- If they fail, they must pay the monetary differential point value, which will be re-directed to the GoFundMe.
- If they succeed, they will receive a booster/promotion/multiplier for N hrs or N+x = N_ hrs or for x hrs. 

Note: For charity sessions with a multiplier and/or promo, points will be directly converted to $, and donated to the GoFundMe. This is to circumvent promotion abuse.
